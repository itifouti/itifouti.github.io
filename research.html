<p>
My research focuses on the development, analysis, and implementation of nonlinear adaptive model order reduction methods for parameterized partial differential equations, with applications to compressible flows and harmonic wave inversion. My background is in partial differential equations and numerical analysis, with training in the development of numerical methods.

<h2>projection-based nonlinear model reduction</h2>
<p>
I develop intrusive projection-based reduced-order models for nonlinear parameterized PDEs. A core direction of my work is registration-based reduction with spatio-parameter adaptivity, designed to handle advection-dominated regimes and moving features. The objective is to build reduced spaces that remain accurate under strong nonlinearities and parametric variability.

<h2>mesh adaptation based on error estimates</h2>
<p>
I develop metric-based anisotropic mesh adaptation strategies driven by error models. In practice, I construct error indicators (feature-based, residual-based, or goal-oriented) and translate them into mesh metrics that guide refinement and coarsening under a fixed complexity budget. This provides controlled discretization error while concentrating degrees of freedom only where they are needed.
</p>

<h2>error estimation and adjoint-based methods</h2>
<p>
I work on error estimation methods, with an emphasis on adjoint-based and goal-oriented techniques. This includes dual-weighted residual formulations used to estimate errors in quantities of interest, assess reduced-order accuracy, and drive adaptive enrichment and discretization strategies.
</p>

<h2>reduced modeling for harmonic wave inversion</h2>
<p>
My current research investigates reduced-order modeling for inverse problems in the frequency domain, in particular harmonic full-wave inversion. The goal is to accelerate repeated forward and adjoint solves required by optimization-based inversion, while maintaining accuracy through error-aware reduced models and adaptive strategies.
</p>

<h2>system identification and non-intrusive methods</h2>
<p>
During my master’s thesis at Sorbonne Université, I studied non-intrusive nonlinear model reduction for unsteady coupled PDEs arising in fluid–structure interaction. This work focused on data-driven dynamical modeling and system identification methods that reconstruct evolution operators from observable outputs.
