<p>
My research concerns the development, analysis, and implementation of projection-based nonlinear model order reduction methods for parameterized partial differential equations. I am particularly interested in problems where strong nonlinearities and transport phenomena make classical linear reduction strategies insufficient.
</p>

<p>
A central aspect of my work is the construction of adaptive reduced-order models that incorporate spatio-parameter registration and metric-based mesh adaptation. These approaches aim at capturing localized structures and sharp solution features in advection-dominated regimes while maintaining computational efficiency.
</p>

<p>
I also work on error estimation and adjoint-based techniques, both for goal-oriented analysis and for guiding adaptive strategies. These tools play a key role in coupling reduced modeling with reliable numerical simulation.
</p>

<p>
My research extends to inverse problems, in particular harmonic full-wave inversion and wave propagation problems arising in seismology. In this context, reduced-order modeling provides a framework for accelerating repeated forward and adjoint simulations.

<p>
Earlier in my work, during my master's thesis at Sorbonne Université, I developed non-intrusive nonlinear model reduction techniques for unsteady coupled fluid–structure interaction problems, with a focus on data-driven and system identification approaches.
